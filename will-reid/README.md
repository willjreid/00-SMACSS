##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Styling related to the whole page, including the reset coding, was more appropriate for the base file; styling related to individual classes and ids seemed more appropriate to the layout file; styling related to navigation items and elements tracked to the modules file.  Specific qualities for exceptional elements (as noted by classes and ids) fell into the Layout.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I started to change some of the element references to classes. However, this appeared to make the code more complex, and since the style guides should exist to offer standardization across recipes, it seemed appropriate for most of the elements to remain.
